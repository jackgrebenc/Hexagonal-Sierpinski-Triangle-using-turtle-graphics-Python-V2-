# Hexagonal Sierpinski Triangle using turtle graphics (Python-V2)
Draws a hexagonal fractal (inspired by 3Blue1Brown youtube video on fractals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB9n2gHsHN4 at 7:16) using pythons turtle graphics.  User inputs modify the pen size and the fractal depth that gets executed (reccomendations are made in the code).

# What I Learned
-> Python turtle graphics basics  
-> Using math and recursive calls to properly draw the fractal on the screen
